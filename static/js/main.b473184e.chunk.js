On the other hand, \n      heading directly into the Mediterranean represents a more direct \n      path to Europe, but the risk of ending up in an \n      overcrowded refugee camp or being turned back by European patrols also makes this option perilous. What do you choose?',"After a couple of days of travel, you arrive on the shores of Libya, ready to make a pass at getting into the \n      \u201cfortress\u201d of Continental Europe. There are a number of routes along Europe\u2019s Mediterranean coast that you and your\n       boat can try to reach, all with their own challenges. \n      As sweat beads down your back, you must choose: which country do you think will be the easiest path forward?","After days at sea, and questionable navigation from the captain, you see something in the distance: a tiny dot of \n      light on a horizon of darkness. At first, you think it\u2019s nothing, but you quickly realize: it\u2019s an Italian Coast \n      Guard Boat. All of a sudden, everyone is panicking. What do you suggest to the group?","You decide to proceed on towards Spain. However, the choices of where in the Iberian Peninsula to aim for are \n      practically limitless, and Spain is notoriously strict on migrants. Where do you choose to aim for?","Like many migrants, you think Greece, one of the least fortified European countries on the Mediterranean, \n      represents a good choice to try and aim for. After days, and mere miles from the coast of Crete, \n      you and your crew run into another boat of migrants from the Turkish coast.

You push off, the captain\u2019s seemingly ancient GPS barely able to calculate \n      where in this cursed ocean your boat is.

Your family\u2019s fate is in their hands.","You and your group decide to simply move ever so slightly from the path, \n    deviating just enough to hopefully escape the lights of the Coast Guard ship. \n    Alas, it is too little too late; a spotlight glares in your face, and before you know it, \n    you are being taken aboard the Coast Guard Ship, likely to be returned to North Africa. \n    You have no idea what you and your family will do next.","You suggest to everyone to remain calm, and simply let the captain, who is most familiar with the boat, to decide. \n    At first, it seems fine: however, after a couple days, it is clear the captain does not know where he is going. \n    A couple days after the food runs out, you become very tired and lie down to rest.

However, where you chose does not matter; little did you know, \n    but there was never enough water for everyone to make it that far across the Mediterranean; your young son dies of \n    thirst first, and you go not much longer after that, with the fate of the rest of your family unknown.","Malaga, a beachy resort town on the Southern Spanish coast, seems like as good a place as any to aim for and hope to \n    make it onto the European mainland.

However, you quickly realize what you thought was the coast of Crete was actually just a rocky \n    outcropping, and soon your supply of clean drinking water runs out. \n    Baking under the Aegean sun, you wonder what would have happened if you chose differently.","You propose a compromise; don\u2019t fully integrate with the other boat, but ask them for directional help and exchange knowledge \n    about changes in patrols or conditions. You have a brief exchange with the others; everyone offers encouragement to one another, \n    though for many language barriers that often means a smile or head nod. They point you westward; you doubt that tip, \n    but it's better than the lost wandering your boat has been doing. After days, you quickly realize you are further from land \n    than when you started, and as you bake under the Aegean sun, \n    you wonder what would have happened if you chose differently.","Result: Your small boat becomes entangled on the reefs around Saint Lucia. The warm water and sun eventually melt the tar that \n    secures the joints of the boat, weakening the rotting planks and loosening them from their rusting nails. The water that leaks \n    through the wood floods the bilge and then rises as high as the oarlocks, closing in around the mummified bodies around you. \n    The current pushes you overboard as you slip away from the boat; after a final gurgle, the last seagull hastens away.","Your boat is swallowed up in the endless Caribbean void, stranded after weeks of drifting across waves \n    and past the deserted beaches of Venezuela.
