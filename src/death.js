    `You arrive on the shores of Lampedusa after a couple hour detour from the intended route. 
    Exhausted, hungry, and thirsty, you clamber out of the boat… right into the hands of an armed guard. 
    You and your group are detained in a “Hot Spot”, a local facility used to hold migrants 
    while they figure out what to do with you. Your family’s fate is in their hands.`,

    `You and your group decide to simply move ever so slightly from the path, 
    deviating just enough to hopefully escape the lights of the Coast Guard ship. 
    Alas, it is too little too late; a spotlight glares in your face, and before you know it, 
    you are being taken aboard the Coast Guard Ship, likely to be returned to North Africa. 
    You have no idea what you and your family will do next.`,

    `You suggest to everyone to remain calm, and simply let the captain, who is most familiar with the boat, to decide. 
    At first, it seems fine: however, after a couple days, it is clear the captain does not know where he is going. 
    A couple days after the food runs out, you become very tired and lie down to rest. You don’t get back up.`,

    `You and your family think that aiming for Gibraltar might help your case, given that it is UK soil and that is a place 
    you might like to hopefully settle someday. However, where you chose does not matter; little did you know, 
    but there was never enough water for everyone to make it that far across the Mediterranean; your young son dies of 
    thirst first, and you go not much longer after that, with the fate of the rest of your family unknown.`,

    `Malaga, a beachy resort town on the Southern Spanish coast, seems like as good a place as any to aim for and hope to 
    make it onto the European mainland. However, where you chose does not matter; little did you know, but there was 
    never enough water for everyone to make it that far across the Mediterranean; your young son dies of thirst first, 
    and you go not much longer after that, with the fate of the rest of your family unknown.`,

    `You suggest aiming for as rural a location as possible, in hopes of making it further into the mainland and avoiding the 
    bust waterfront and its Coast Guard patrols. 
    However, where you chose does not matter; little did you know, but there was never enough water for everyone to 
    make it that far across the Mediterranean; your young son dies of thirst first, and you go not much longer after that, 
    with the fate of the rest of your family unknown.`,

    `You, your family, and most of the other migrants on board agree to team up with the other boat in order to pool resources 
    and knowledge, a great boon for the many souls getting by on an increasingly insufficient amount of food and water. 
    This is a great help, as the other boat has more food than is needed for the few souls on board; however, 
    a huge storm arises just as you begin to hear the sounds of the ocean 
    lapping against the shore, stirring up a current that whips both of your boats back out into the sea.`,

    `Given the possible risks, you propose that simply continuing without interacting with the other boat would be best, 
    and the others agree. However, you quickly realize what you thought was the coast of Crete was actually just a rocky 
    outcropping, and soon your supply of clean drinking water runs out. 
    Baking under the Aegean sun, you wonder what would have happened if you chose differently.`,

    `You propose a compromise; don’t fully integrate with the other boat, but ask them for directional help and exchange knowledge 
    about changes in patrols or conditions. You have a brief exchange with the others; everyone offers encouragement to one another, 
    though for many language barriers that often means a smile or head nod. They point you westward; you doubt that tip, 
    but it's better than the lost wandering your boat has been doing. After days, you quickly realize you are further from land 
    than when you started, and as you bake under the Aegean sun, 
    you wonder what would have happened if you chose differently.`,

    `Result: Your small boat becomes entangled on the reefs around Saint Lucia. The warm water and sun eventually melt the tar that 
    secures the joints of the boat, weakening the rotting planks and loosening them from their rusting nails. The water that leaks 
    through the wood floods the bilge and then rises as high as the oarlocks, closing in around the mummified bodies around you. 
    The current pushes you overboard as you slip away from the boat; after a final gurgle, the last seagull hastens away.`,

    `Your boat is swallowed up in the endless Caribbean void, stranded after weeks of drifting across waves 
    and past the deserted beaches of Venezuela. The warm water and sun eventually melt the tar that secures 
    the joints of the boat, weakening the rotting planks and loosening them from their rusting nails. The water 
    that leaks through the wood floods the bilge and then rises as high as the oarlocks, closing in around the mummified bodies. 
    The current pushes you overboard as you slip away from the boat; after a final gurgle, the last seagull hastens away.`
