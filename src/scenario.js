      `Before your small crew has even left home, there is a decision to make: will you proceed westwards or northwards?
      "If you head out into the Atlantic in an attempt to reach the Canary Islands,"
      the possibility of making it to these little outposts 
      of “Europe” will provide a definite safe haven for you and your family: 
      however, the possibility of overshooting and sailing out into 
      the depths of the Atlantic is an enormous risk. On the other hand, 
      heading directly into the Mediterranean represents a more direct 
      path to Europe, but the risk of ending up in an 
      overcrowded refugee camp or being turned back by European patrols also makes this option perilous. What do you choose?`,

      `After a couple of days of travel, you arrive on the shores of Libya, ready to make a pass at getting into the 
      “fortress” of Continental Europe. There are a number of routes along Europe’s Mediterranean coast that you and your
       boat can try to reach, all with their own challenges. 
      As sweat beads down your back, you must choose: which country do you think will be the easiest path forward?`,

      `After days at sea, and questionable navigation from the captain, you see something in the distance: a tiny dot of 
      light on a horizon of darkness. At first, you think it’s nothing, but you quickly realize: it’s an Italian Coast 
      Guard Boat. All of a sudden, everyone is panicking. What do you suggest to the group?` ,

      `You decide to proceed on towards Spain. However, the choices of where in the Iberian Peninsula to aim for are 
      practically limitless, and Spain is notoriously strict on migrants. Where do you choose to aim for?` ,

      `Like many migrants, you think Greece, one of the least fortified European countries on the Mediterranean, 
      represents a good choice to try and aim for. After days, and mere miles from the coast of Crete, 
      you and your crew run into another boat of migrants from the Turkish coast. What do you do with this other boat?` ,
      
      `After arriving at the shores of Senegal, your family sneaks to the beach, where a captain and a number of other 
      families wait huddled in the darkness. You push off, the captain’s seemingly ancient GPS barely able to calculate 
      where in this cursed ocean your boat is. You feel a strong breeze on your back, but you’re not exactly sure which 
      way that breeze is blowing. Which direction do you hope the wind is blowing?`,
